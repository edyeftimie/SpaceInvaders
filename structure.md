Design patterns:
    - game loop pattern:
    - component pattern
        -> spaceship
        -> enemies
        -> bullets
        -> ability boxes
    - state pattern:
        -> game states (start, palying, game over)
        -> enemy states (moving, shooting, destroyed)
        -> bullet states (created, moving, hit something)
    - factory pattern:
        -> differen types of enemies
        -> bullet variations
        -> ability power-ups
    - observer pattern:
        -> tracking score
        -> handling collisions
        -> managing game events
    - singleton pattern:
        -> game manager
        -> score keeper
    - strategy pattern:
        -> shooting strategies (single, triple)
        -> movement strategies (straight down, zig-zag, diagonal)
    - decorator pattern:
        -> armour to enemy
        -> speed boost
